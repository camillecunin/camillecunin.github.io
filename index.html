<h3><i class="fa fa-briefcase"></i> My Experiences </h3>
<ul class="timeline">
<li>
<h5>November 2019 – March 2020</h5>
    <h4 style="color:#008;">RESEARCH STUDENT, Harvard Med School</h4>
    <b><i>The Albers Lab – MassGeneral Institute for Neurodegenerative Disease (MIND) - MGH – BOSTON</i></b><br>
<p>
    The Albers Laboratory uses the olfactory system of mice and humans to explore early pathologic events of neurodegeneration. Amazed by the brain and curious about research in neuroscience, I started working in this lab during my free time on a novel algorithm capable of predicting progression to amnestic-MCI or Alzheimer’s disease among healthy elderly individuals, based on their scores on both odor naming and odor memory performance.<br>
</p>
</li>

<li>
<h5>February 2019 – March 2020</h5>
<h4 style="color:#008;">RESEARCH STUDENT, Harvard University</h4>
    <b><i>The Tearney Lab – Wellman Center for Photomedicine - MGH – BOSTON</i></b><br>
<p>
    I worked on a challenging project to design a novel, minimal invasive, and high-resolution OCT-imaging device to diagnose Crohn’s disease. My research work mainly consisted in developing an OCT-TCE device capable of reaching the terminal ileum, in determining imaging criteria for mapping the gastrointestinal tract, and in carrying on ex vivo and in vivo swine studies before going into humans. The first six-months at the Tearney Lab validated my first year of master’s degree in General Engineering. I had the chance to pursue my work on this challenging project for six more months.<br>
</p>

<h5>June 2019 – August 2019</h5>
<h4 style="color:#008;">RESEARCH STUDENT, Harvard University</h4>
    <b><i>The Tearney Lab – Wellman Center for Photomedicine - MGH – BOSTON</i></b><br>
<p>In parallel with my internship, I completed a three-month program in biomedical optics at MGH. Through hands-on research experience, this program trains participants in the study and innovation of biomedical optics for improving human health and advancing biological sciences. Students are challenged to explore ways to conduct research responsibly and to achieve the skills to communicate research findings effectively through oral presentations, scientific poster presentation and a large panel of courses on diverse medical or engineering topics.<br>
</p>

<h5>August 2018</h5>
<h4 style="color:#008;">INTERN, École Centrale de Marseille</h4>
<b><i>Grands Moulins Storione – MARSEILLE</i></b><br>
<p>As a first working experience in a laboratory, I discovered how to control wheat’s quality by carrying out tests on wheat greats and flour such as measures of humidity and ash contend.<br>

<h5>2020</h5>
    <h4 style="color:#085;">SELECTIVE LOSS OF EPISODIC MEMORY OF ODOR PERCEPTS PREDICTS PROGRESSION TO AMNESTIC MCI OR ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE</h4>
    <b>The Albers Lab (MIND) - Boston</b><br>
<p>
    After statistically analyzing odor memory scores collected in a longitudinal cohort, I took part, as third author, in the writing of a short report disclosing the potential of a selective deficit on episodic odor memory for predicting cognitive decline among cognitively normal elderly individuals. Before the COVID-19 pandemic changed my plans, I was working on a second manuscript, a global review on existing olfactory-based approaches used to detect early stages of Alzheimer’s disease in pre-clinical but asymptomatic individuals.<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
    <h5>2019-2020</h5>
    <h4 style="color:#085;"><img src="img/pig.png" class="pig-img">OCT-TCE DEVICE FOR DETAILED VISUALIZATION OF THE TERMINAL ILEUM</h4>
    <b>The Tearney Lab (Wellman Center for Photmedicine, MGH) - Boston</b><br>
<p>
    I worked on a challenging project to design a novel, minimal invasive, and high-resolution OCT-imaging device to diagnose Crohn’s disease. This 1-year internship has provided me with a strong experience in biomedical research as I have learnt how to conduct research protocols and animal studies, how to validate my experiments and how to present my work through weekly meetings, scientific poster presentations, slam talks or mid-term advancement calls.<br>
</p>
</li>
  
<li>
    <h5>2018</h5>
    <h4 style="color:#085;">IOT Project - Li-Fi</h4>
    <b>École Centrale de Marseille</b><br>
<p>
    For six months, I worked closely with researchers studying Li-Fi technology. The aim of this project was to understand how light can spread information. Then, with my team, we laid the foundations for a prototype capable of spreading data via variations of its intensity. As the light cannot penetrate through walls, the signal sent through Li-Fi technology cannot be hacked from a remote location.<br>
</p>
</li>
    
<li>
    <h5>2015-2016</h5>
    <h4 style="color:#085;">DAMPING OF LIQUID SLOSHING BY FOAMS</h4>
    <b>Lycée Louis-le-Grand</b><br>
    <p>In my undergraduate preparatory classes, I studied the damping effect of liquid sloshing by foams. More specifically, I worked on the damping effect of a beer foam on top of the liquid. I built a model to describe the foam contribution to the damping coefficient through vicious dissipation on the wall of the container.<br>
